Value 1: amount / glitching / chromatic                              (Leave it blank for a random number between 0.10 to 0.50)
Value 2: on / chromatic amount                                          (Value 2 is only for glitching / chromatic)
Recommended to use numbers between 0 to 1.

You can only choose "on" with glitching on Value 1.
With "chromatic" the same, with "amount" is only
a number. If you did not understand the above then:
Glitching screen: v1 = glitching, v2 = on
Chromatic: v1 = chromatic, v2 = your amount

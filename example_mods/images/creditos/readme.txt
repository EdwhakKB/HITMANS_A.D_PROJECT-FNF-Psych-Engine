To make credits inside hitmans mod you should do this

make a "json" file called "Datos" (spanish since i'm spanish ofc)

then make this:

{	
"character":
[
	["(here the user name)",(here the space of the text [Number]),	"(what they did)",(here the size of the text [Number]),(add whatever number here it does nothing lmao),"(The social stuff about that user[youtube/Twitter and others])"],
]
}

sorry for long tutorial but still have fun!
